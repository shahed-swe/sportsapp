Drill Upload Fix and Admin Access Bug

Bug 1: Upload Failed on Drill Page (User Side)

When a user tries to upload a video for any drill, the upload fails and shows an error (e.g., "upload failed")(as shown in attached image).

✅ Fix required: Ensure the video file upload logic is working correctly — store it properly (e.g., in database or storage folder), allow common formats like .mp4, ect and confirm file size handling.

✅ After selecting and uploading a video, a “Change Video” option should appear and the “Submit Drill” button should activate.

✅ After clicking "Submit Drill", update drill status to Under Review and reflect it instantly.

Bug 2: Admin Cannot Access Drill Management Panel (Admin Side)

Even after successful admin login, visiting “Drill Management” in the admin panel shows a "You don't have access to this page" error.

✅ Fix required: Properly authenticate admin session and role so that logged-in admin can access all sections of admin panel including “Drill Management”.

Functionality Reminder:

Admin should be able to:

See all uploaded drills categorized under: All, Pending, Accepted, Rejected. and can view al the drills uploaded. for that give a view button in every drill, which open a popup of dril heading, description and the video which will autoplay.

Filter by sport (Cricket, Football, etc.).

Search users by name and view all drills submitted by them.

Accept or reject each drill.

On acceptance: Update status to Accepted, add 10 points to user's profile (real-time).

On rejection: Status becomes Rejected, allow re-upload with message: “Please try again with better drill.”

Once a drill is accepted, uploading again for that drill should be disabled.

Notifications Fix:

When a drill is accepted or rejected, user should get real-time notification.

Clicking the notification should take user directly to the corresponding sport’s drill section.

Design & Layout:

✅ Keep layout mobile and desktop responsive.

✅ List view (1 drill per row).

✅ Use same style as used in other list views (e.g., redeem history or search).
