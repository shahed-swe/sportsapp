Recreate the Home Page of SportsApp with the following structure and styling.

✅ Keep the existing navbar at the top.

🏠 Hero Section:

Just below the navbar, add a vibrant and visually appealing background image generated by AI. This image should include elements from multiple sports like cricket, football, tennis, badminton, kabaddi, athletics, etc. The image should stretch from under the navbar to the end of the hero section (one screen height).

Overlay the following content on top of this background image:

At the top: a sporty and large heading —“SportsApp – An Ultimate Sport Network”

Below the heading, add a descriptive tagline:“Welcome to India’s fastest growing sports platform.Connect with athletes, enhance your skill, and earn money.”

Add two call-to-action buttons below the description:

Join Community → redirects to the feed page

Do Drills and Earn → redirects to the drill page

These buttons should be:

Visually attractive, with shadows and modern styling

In a row on desktop, and stacked vertically on mobile

Ensure:

Proper padding above and below the hero content so it looks balanced.

Add margin between heading, description, and buttons.

Text should be readable over the background image (add overlay if needed).

Keep the design clean, sporty, and not overly colorful.

📊 Impact Section (Below Hero):

Use a plain white background to contrast the vibrant hero section.

Add a heading: “Our Impact”

Display 3 stat cards in a row (responsive in mobile and desktop).

Each card should include:

A large number in colored text, semi-bold.

Below it, a short description in black text.

Content for the 3 cards:

200+ → “Drills uploaded every week”

500+ → “Users redeem their points every month”

100+ → “Users take AI cricket coaching every week”

Cards should not have background boxes, only text and number.

🏆 Our Recent Winners Section (Below Impact):

Use a light orange background to visually differentiate from above.

Add a heading: “Our Recent Winners”

On desktop: all 4 in a row.
