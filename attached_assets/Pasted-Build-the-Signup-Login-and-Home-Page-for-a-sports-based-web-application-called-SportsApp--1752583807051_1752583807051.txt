Build the **Signup, Login, and Home Page** for a sports-based web application called **“SportsApp”**. The website should be **fully responsive** for both desktop and mobile views.

### ✅ Signup Page

* Build a **responsive signup page** that works on both desktop and mobile.

* The signup form should ask for the following fields in **this exact order**:

  1. Full Name
  2. Username
  3. User Type (select one: **Sports Fan** or **Athlete**)
  4. Email
  5. Phone Number (must be 10 digits and unique)
  6. Password
  7. Confirm Password

* **Real-Time Validation**:

  * When a username is already taken, show:

    * ❌ “Username already taken”
    * ✅ Suggest two alternative available usernames, like: `navii`, `navi01`
  * If email is already registered, show:

    * ❌ “Email already registered” (without submitting the form)
  * Phone number:

    * Must be exactly 10 digits
    * Must be unique (one phone per account)

    *(Make the same dropdown options functional on desktop too)*

* Table Columns:

  * Full Name
