Change the redeem process and add Redeem Management in the admin panel. Also fix some bugs in the profile page and edit profile section.

Edit Profile Updates:

Allow user to edit username, full name, bio, and profile picture.

When user changes username (available username), make the new username taken and release the old one (available for others).

On profile picture, add a plus (+) icon. On click, open the gallery to select a new image. After selection, update the profile picture everywhere: feed, profile page, etc.

Fix Bugs in Profile Page:

In post section of user’s profile page, currently nothing is clickable. Make it fully functional like the feed page.

Enable: give point (only on other's profile), comment, delete post, report post, clickable @mentioned usernames, clickable tagged users, etc.

Redeem Process Changes:

When a user clicks Redeem, calculate amount as 1/5 of current points (e.g., 25–29 points = ₹5, 30–34 = ₹6, and so on).

After clicking Redeem, ask for user’s email with a Submit button (if user can redeem 1 or more that 1 rupees (equal or more that 5 points), in case user have less that 5 points, redeem button will be inactive).

Show this disclaimer:

“Our team will reach you within 7 business days. Make sure you have sports content posted and are active on Sportsapp. In case our team finds you ineligible, your points will not be returned.”

After redeeming, set user’s point balance to 0.

Redeem Management (Admin Panel):

Add a new card in admin panel titled Redeem Management.

Maintain a list that updates in real-time after every redemption.

List columns: Username, Full Name, Email, Points Redeemed, Amount Redeemed, View Profile (opens user’s profile), Approve button, and Reject button.

After clicking Approve/Reject, status should update accordingly (approved/rejected).

User Redeem History:

Beside the Redeem button in My Profile, add Redeem History.

Show: Points Redeemed, Amount, Status (default: under review).

After admin approval: status changes to Approved with message:

“Congrats! You are a star. You’ve been posting great sports content and you’ve won a voucher. You'll receive redeemed amount within 7 business days”

After admin rejection: status changes to Rejected with message:

“We’re sorry, but you’re not eligible for redemption now. Keep posting good sports content and stay active on SportsApp.”
