add credentials to admin panel and fix some bugs-

### ðŸ”’ Admin Panel Security & Authentication:

1. **Create a completely separate database (or secure JSON/object store) for admin login credentials.**

   * Do **not** store admin credentials with user data.
   * Admin login credentials are:

     * **Username:** `adminangad`
     * **Password:** `angadadmin`
   * Use strong hashing and secure verification (if possible).
   * This ensures **users can never access or guess admin credentials**, even through database inspection.

2. Only after successful login with these credentials, should the user be granted **admin access**.

   * Once logged in as admin:

     * User sees full admin panel dashboard.
     * The feed page now includes **delete options** on all posts.
     * The admin session is maintained securely.
   * No normal user should ever access admin functionality.

### ðŸ“Š Admin Panel Structure & Functionality:

After admin login, redirect to **Admin Dashboard** with the following sections:

#### 1. **User Management:**

* Show real-time list of all registered users.
* Details: `Full Name`, `Username`, `Email`, `Phone`.
* Two CTAs:

  * `View`: Open a popup with full user details (name, username, email, phone, registration date, etc.).
  * `Delete`: Remove the user from the user database and free up that username, email, and phone number.
* Newest users appear on top.
* Include a search bar to find users by name or username.

#### 2. **Post Management:**

Two sections:

##### a) **Total Activity:**

* On top: Two cards â€” `Total Posts` and `New Posts (Last 24 Hours)`.
* Below that: List of all posts with:

  * `Username`, `Full Name`, `Post Type`, `Caption`
  * CTAs:

    * `View`: Open a popup showing full post details, including uploaded media if present.
    * `Delete`: Delete that post from everywhere (user feed, user profile, admin panel).
* Real-time updates, no lag.

##### b) **Reported Posts:**

* When any user **reports a post** from the feed, that post appears here in real-time.
* List of all reported posts with CTAs:

  * `View`: See post details and media.
  * `Delete`: Permanently delete the post from database.
  * `Ignore`: Remove the post from reported list but keep it visible in feed.

### ðŸ“¦ Data Connection Notes:

* Admin panel will **only read/write** to the **shared post/user database** to manage content (post visibility, deletion, moderation).
* Admin credentials and sessions are **completely isolated** in a **separate, secure admin-only database.**
* This prevents:

  * Admin credential leaks.
  * Unauthorized access via user database tampering.

### âœ… Summary:

* Posts will remain visible and manageable in admin panel.
* Admin login is secure and not part of user system.
* All admin features (user delete, post delete, report handling) work in real time.
* Security-first: no user should be able to access admin data or impersonate admin.
