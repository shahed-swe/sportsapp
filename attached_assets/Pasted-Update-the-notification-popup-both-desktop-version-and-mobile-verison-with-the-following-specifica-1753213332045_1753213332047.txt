It should:

Slide in from the right

Someone commented on a post

Verification request approved or rejected

Drill video approved (user earns points) or rejected

Tryout request approved or rejected

Show number of pending notification on the notification icon, and remove the number when user opens notification popup. after opening pop up and cutting , and new notification will again, then only that notification will count as unseen. example- If 2 notifications are unseen, show badge "2" on the notification icon in the navbar
