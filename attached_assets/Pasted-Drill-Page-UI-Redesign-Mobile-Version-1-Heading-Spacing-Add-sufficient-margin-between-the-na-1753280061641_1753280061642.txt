Drill Page UI Redesign

📱 Mobile Version

1. Heading Spacing:

Add sufficient margin between the navbar and the “Do Drills and Earn” heading so it doesn’t look cramped.

2. Section Title:

“Select a Sport” text should be center-aligned.

3. Sport Cards Grid:

Arrange sport cards in a 2-column grid:

Total 7 sports = 4 rows (last row with 1 item centered).

All sport cards should be:

Square-shaped, same size.

Have vibrant and visually appealing background colors.

Card content layout:

At the top: Animated 3D sport icon

Below icon: Sport name in semi bold, white or dark (readable) text (same for all cards).

Ensure enough margin between cards.

Example icons & animations:

🏏 Cricket: Bat & ball — ball hits bat repeatedly

⚽ Football: Realistic football spinning on axis

🎾 Tennis: Racket & ball — ball bounces

🏸 Badminton: Racket & shuttle — shuttle moves

🏑 Hockey: Stick & ball. ball hitting the stick again and again

🤼‍♂️ Kabaddi: Kabaddi icon movement (light pulse animation)

🏃 Athletics: Running shoes or track lane — slight bounce effect

Icons animate continuously, not too fast, consistent timing

Only icon should animate, background color and text are static

Icons must not overflow card bounds, must look clean & sporty

4. Submit Button:

Full width, slightly reduced height

Use same gradient styling as the Create Post button from Feed Page

Button must be visually standout, but sporty

💻 Desktop Version

1. Layout:

Use a 2-row layout:

First row: 4 cards

Second row: 3 cards

Cards should be larger than mobile version but maintain square shape

Follow the same animated icons and design rules as mobile version

2. Width Consistency:

All content (heading, description, sport cards, submit button) should align with the same width as feed page — keep design uniform across site

3. Submit Button:

No change in size just change the colour with Create post button colour in desktop.

🚫 Do Not Touch

Functionality of page (no logic changes)

Any Other page

Animations should be vector-based or lightweight 3D, no heavy scripts
