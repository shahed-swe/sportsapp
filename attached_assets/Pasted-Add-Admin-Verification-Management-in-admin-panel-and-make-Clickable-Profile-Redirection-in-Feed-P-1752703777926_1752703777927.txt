Add Admin Verification Management in admin panel and make Clickable Profile Redirection in Feed

✅ PART 1: Add "Verification Management" to Admin Panel

🔸 Verification Management Card:

Add a new card in the Admin Panel homepage titled “Verification Management”

On clicking, redirect to a new page: /admin/verification-management

📋 Inside Verification Management Page:

🔹 Show a List/Table of All Verification Requests

Each row should include:

Profile Picture

Full Name

Username

Email

Status (Pending / Verified / Rejected)

3 CTA Buttons:

View Profile → Opens the user's profile page

Verify → Changes status to "Verified"

This adds a blue tick badge to the user’s name everywhere (feed, profile, etc.)

In the user's profile: "Request Verification" changes to "Redeem Voucher"

Reject → Changes status to "Rejected"

In the user's profile: "Verification Under Process" becomes "Request Rejected, Try Again"

🔹 Real-time Updates:

When any user requests verification, the entry should appear in this list immediately (no page refresh needed).

Actions (verify/reject) must reflect instantly on both admin and user side.

✅ PART 2: Make Profile Navigation Interactive in Feed Page

🧩 Add Clickable Redirects in Feed Page for:

Profile Avatar

When clicked → Redirect to the respective user's profile page.

Full Name and Username in Post Header

Both should link to that user's profile page.

@Mentioned Users in Caption

The "@username" in caption must be a clickable link → Redirects to mentioned user's profile.

Tagged Users in Media

Clicking the Tag Icon on media should open a popup listing tagged users.

Each listed user should have clickable name → opens their profile.

✨ Additional Details:

All redirected profile pages should use the correct data from the database (no mix-up of usernames).

Profile page layout should remain the same as defined in Prompt 3.

Blue tick must be shown for verified users beside the username on:

Feed Posts

Profile Page

Mentions & Tags

✅ Security & Flow Recap:

Only the admin user (with secure login) can access Verification Management.

Admin Panel is stored in a separate database from user data to ensure security.

Actions like "verify" or "reject" update only that user's record.

All updates should sync in real time across frontend and admin view.
