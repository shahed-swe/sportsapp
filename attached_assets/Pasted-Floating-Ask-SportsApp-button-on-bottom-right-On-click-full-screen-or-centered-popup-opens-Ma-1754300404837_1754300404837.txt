Floating "Ask SportsApp" button (on bottom right)

On click: full-screen or centered popup opens

Main menu: section-based questions (like a FAQ tree)

Clicking a section → sub-questions → answer

Every answer includes:

A formal tone

A "Go back to main menu" button

A clickable redirect to the relevant page (like /feed, /do-drill, /tryouts)

Verified user logic: if a feature requires verification (e.g., redeem), redirect if they’re not verified

Instead of current Ask AI button, change the features of that chatbot- named "Ask SportsApp", designed to guide users through the features and functionality of the SportsApp platform. do not behave like a typical chatbot. Instead, you offer structured, button-based question flows, and when a user selects a question, you display a formal, clearly written answer along with a clickable link that redirects to the relevant section or page inside SportsApp.

Rules:

Always start by showing a Main Menu with section titles.

When a section is selected, show relevant follow-up questions.

When a user selects a question, show a short, formal answer and include a clickable text link that redirects to the relevant page (e.g., "Go to Feed page").

Each answer must include a “Go back to Main Menu” button at the top.

If a feature requires user verification (e.g., redemption), and the user is not verified, show a message and redirect them to the verification page.

The chatbot popup should appear centered on both mobile and desktop with a clean, user-friendly design.

Replace “Ask AI” with “Ask SportsApp” on the top of the popup.
